### I learned how to program for the wrong reason: to make money.

Because of this, I missed so much of the beauty of the process of learning this incredibly useful skill. And even when I found a bit of success, I felt like a fraud because I didn't know everything possible. Well, after learning more, I've realized that it's pretty hard to learn everything possible... it's pretty damn hard to even tell what that is... until you start working. After you take a few steps, you can see a few more. You keep taking them and see where it leads.

Anyway, that's what I intend to do. I intend to use these skills to actually build useful stuff that I need and stuff that I love.
